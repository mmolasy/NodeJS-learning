New Auditor General 
appointed

1.1	I was appointed Auditor General on December 1, 2010. My 
predecessor, Mike Ferguson, CA, resigned effective November 30, 
2010 to accept the position of Deputy Minister of Finance. I look 
forward to continuing to work with Mr. Ferguson as we take up our 
new roles, and wish to thank him sincerely for his contribution to the 
Province as Auditor General.

1.2	This volume of our Report deals with matters arising from 
our financial audits of the Province and its Crown agencies for the 
year ended March 31, 2010. During the conduct of these audits, I 
served as Comptroller of the Province and, in that role, I was 
responsible for, or to some extent involved with, much of the 
material that was being audited by the Office of the Auditor General. 
Hence, a number of the observations and recommendations in this 
Report were directed to me in my former position as the Comptroller.

1.3	The chapters in this volume of my Report were drafted prior 
to my arrival in the Office of the Auditor General. Except for this 
introductory chapter, I have not edited the chapters, or made any 
comments on the material since I became Auditor General. The 
chapters were managed to completion by the Deputy Auditor 
General, Ken Robinson, CA, whose work during this transitional 
phase has been much appreciated. However, I acknowledge that, as 
Auditor General, I am responsible to present this Report to the 
Legislative Assembly and, as Auditor General, I stand behind and 
fully support its contents.

Issues raised in prior 
years                      
Release of financial 
information

1.4	I was pleased to see the government release the financial 
statements of the Province on August 13, 2010. This was a 
significant improvement on recent years, and well in advance of the 
September 27, 2010 election. I am hoping that the early release will 
set the pattern for future years. Financial information is most useful if 
it is timely.

Year end grant payments

1.5	There were no advanced payments of grants in either the 2009 
or the 2010 fiscal years. This is a good thing, since the advanced 
payment of grants distorts the financial results for any given year, 
and makes year-to-year comparisons difficult.

Future oriented information

1.6	The government is still providing only limited information on 
its financial expectations. As we enter a period of significant 
restraint, with the prospect of large deficits, it is increasingly 
important that government explains clearly to its citizens what the 
situation looks like now, how it is expected to look in the future, and 
what plans it has to bring its revenues and expenses closer into 
balance. Government also needs to focus on managing and 
explaining its net debt, which is expected to increase significantly in 
the coming years, placing an increasing financial burden on 
taxpayers.

Public-private partnerships

1.7	My Office has begun a project to review a number of public-
private partnerships entered into by government in recent years. Our 
objective is to assess whether such arrangements provide good value 
for money for the Province. I anticipate that my 2011 Report will 
contain the results of this work.

Information in this 
volume

1.8	This volume contains a lot of information including 
management letter recommendations we made as a result of our 
financial audits, the results of our information systems work, and 
detailed analysis of certain financial information.

1.9	It also contains, in chapter 5, our own accountability report. 
This chapter assesses our own performance against the indicators we 
established as part of our strategic planning process. It also points out 
our need for additional resources in order to continue to provide 
objective information useful to the Legislative Assembly.

Acknowledgements

1.10	My Office is grateful for the continuing cooperation we 
receive from government departments and agencies during the course 
of our financial audit work.

1.11	I want to thank all the staff of the Office for their 
professionalism and their dedication to the work they do. They are 
truly committed to our mission of promoting accountability in 
government.
